# Iterations 2

whole_numbers <- c(1:20)
sum(whole_numbers)

# Again, a horrible example of iterations
# i <- 1
# total <- 0
# while (i < length(whole_numbers) + 1){
#   total <- total + whole_numbers[i]
#   i <- i + 1
# }
# total
#
# The code to achieve the solution with iterations is inecessary long
